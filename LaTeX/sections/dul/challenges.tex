\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]{Unsupervised Learning - Challenges}
    Why is unsupervised learning challenging?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Exploratory data analysis}: Unsupervised learning is often used for exploratory data analysis, where the goal is to discover patterns or structures in the data without any prior knowledge of the labels.
        \item \textbf{Difficult to assess performance}: Evaluating the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms can be challenging, as there are no ground truth labels to compare against ("right answer" unknown).
        \item \textbf{Sensitivity to noise}: Unsupervised learning algorithms can be sensitive to noise and outliers in the data, which can lead to misleading results.
        \item \textbf{Curse of dimensionality}: As the number of features increases, the data becomes sparse, making it difficult to find meaningful patterns.
    \end{itemize}
